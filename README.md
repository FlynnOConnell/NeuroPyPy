Hi, I'm Flynn.

Software enthusiast who loves programming and pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone. My journey started with C++, a challenging but ~~rewarding~~ mostly challanging first step, and it has now expanded to Python, Rust, Javascript, and several web dev tools. If it can be learned, I want to learn it. 

- [This project](https://github.com/NeuroPyPy/metricspace) is one of my favorites, using rust to speed up a time-series classification algorithm.
- [A GUI plugin](https://github.com/NeuroPyPy/PremierSuite) for rocket league.
- [My portfolio website,](https://github.com/NeuroPyPy/FlynnPortfolio) handmade with Vue.js.
- Several data-analysis projects, for [electrophysiology](https://github.com/NeuroPyPy/neuroexplore) and [calcium imaging](https://github.com/NeuroPyPy/canalysis).

Currently, I'm using my skills to develop a portfolio website using Nuxt.js/Vue.js and Flask. You can check out <a href=https://flynno.dev> my website here. </a>
Some other things I'm working on: 

- 100% Rusty back-end / front end messaging and communication server, [Fluke](https://github.com/LukeBrandon/fluke)
- [Python based data sharing server](https://github.com/NeuroPyPy/neuroexplore) through google cloud platform
