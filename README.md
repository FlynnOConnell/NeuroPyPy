Hi, I'm Flynn.

Software enthusiast who loves programming and pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone. My journey started with C++, a challenging but ~~rewarding~~ mostly challanging first step, and it has now expanded to Python, Rust, Javascript, and several web dev tools. If it can be learned, I want to learn it. 

I've developed AI pipelines, made GUI plugins and crafted Rust vectorization algorithms. I'm always ready to absorb new knowledge and techniques to refine my craft.

Currently, I'm using my skills to develop a portfolio website using Nuxt.js/Vue.js and Flask. You can check out <a href=https://flynno.dev> my website here. </a>
What I'm working on ðŸ› 

- 100% Rusty back-end / front end messaging and communication server
- Neural classification algorithm with rust vectorization functions using Pyo3/Maturin 
- Python based data sharing server through google cloud platform
- Firestore / vuejs database integration 
- Open source contributions whenever I can!
